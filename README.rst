Mutation Testing in Patterns
****************************

Mutation testing is a technique used to evaluate the quality of existing software
tests. Mutation testing involves modifying a program in small ways, for example
replacing ``True`` constants with ``False`` and re-running its test suite.
When the test suite fails the *mutant* is *killed*. This tells us how good the
test suite is. The goal of this paper is to describe different software and
testing patterns related using practical examples.

Some of them are language specific so please see the relevant sections for
information about installing and running the necessary tools and examples.
