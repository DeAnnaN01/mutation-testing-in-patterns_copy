"Initially we start with a set of tests which doesn't validate default "
"values for method parameters. It may validate some other behavior which "
"was considered more important at the time. In this example the test is "

"isn't consumed in the base class. In the ``RuralRoad`` constructor we've "
"forgotten to pass the ``speedLimit`` parameter to the base constructor. "
