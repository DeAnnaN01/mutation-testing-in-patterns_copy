"The ``TestFlaky`` test isn't reliable because it doesn't take into "
"account the interaction with the filesystem. In the example above the "
"first 2 lines appear when *Cosmic-Ray* executes the baseline test suite, "
"that is execute the test suite without any modifications. The next 2 "
"lines come when ``upcase`` is mutated to ``True`` and the last 3 lines "
"come when ``number`` is mutated to ``3``."

"Notice that ``TestFlaky`` never asserts the contents of the written text,"

"Since commit `db7b7c6` Cosmic Ray will fail if baseline test execution "
"fails. This isn't the same as having unreliable tests but may help you "

"experiment execute the above `cosmic-ray run` command twice without "
"deleting `test.txt` between test runs!"
